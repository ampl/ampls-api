Generic Examples
================

These examples use the generic interface, which allow the same set of functions to be called on all supported solvers.

Example: load
-------------

This example shows how to load a model, solve it and display basic information.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../cpp/generic/examples/loadModel.cpp
   :language: cpp

Example: info callback
----------------------

This example shows how to monitor the progress of the solution process by registering a callback.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../cpp/generic/examples/getInformation.cpp
   :language: cpp
